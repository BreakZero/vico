# Additions

- A `tintDrawable` parameter in `drawableShape`.
- XML attributes for the positions of labels along vertical axes and the rotation of axis labels.
- Default values for the `density`, `fontScale`, and `isLtr` parameters of `drawContext`.

# Resolved issues

- The drawing of some labels along vertical axes could be wrongly skipped.
- The shadows of persistent markers were clipped.
- Vertical axes could display a label of negative zero.
- Top horizontal axes were drawn too high up.
- `drawableShape` was distorted in some cases.

# Other

- `DefaultAxisFormatter` is now called `DefaultAxisValueFormatter`.
