This release contains the following changes.

## Additions

- the ability to listen to marker visibility changes (see `MarkerVisibilityChangeListener`)

## Improvements

- The scale factor of non-scrollable charts can now be lower than 1. This prevents an empty space from being shown in charts with few entries.

## Dependency updates

- The `compose`, `compose-m2`, and `compose-m3` modules now use Jetpack Compose version `1.2.0-rc02`.
- The `compose-m3` module now uses `androidx.compose.material3:material3` version `1.0.0-alpha13`.
