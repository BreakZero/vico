This release contains the following changes.

## Additions

- the ability to listen to marker visibility changes (see `MarkerVisibilityChangeListener`)

## Improvements

- The scale factor of non-scrollable charts can now be lower than 1. This prevents an empty space from being shown in charts with few entries.
