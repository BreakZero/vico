This release includes the following changes.

## Improvements

- Column charts now support data sets in which positive and negative values are mixed together.

## Resolved issues

- Charts consumed more gestures than necessary in some instances.
- For scrollable charts, the chart scale wasnâ€™t considered when the maximum scroll distance was being calculated, which caused scrolling-related bugs.
